# jQuery Zoom Plugin for Tx Projects
================================

TxElevate - A jQuery image zoom plugin

Originally forked from [elevateweb/elevatezoom](https://github.com/elevateweb/elevatezoom) but significantly modified to fit our projects.

## Getting Started

Include jQuery and the plugin on a page. Include your images and initialise the plugin.

```html
<img id="zoom_01" src='images/image.png'/>

<script>
    $('#zoom_01').txElevate();
</script>
```

For more information on how to setup and customise, [check the original projects examples](http://www.elevateweb.co.uk/image-zoom/examples). We have removed many options that we felt were not needed for our project, so check the code.
